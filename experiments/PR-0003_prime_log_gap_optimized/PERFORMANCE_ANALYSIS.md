# Performance Analysis Report: PR-0003 Prime Log-Gap Experiment

**Date:** December 22, 2025  
**Analyst:** GitHub Copilot  
**Subject:** Analysis of sub-linear scaling claims (~0.86 efficiency factor)

## Executive Summary

This report investigates the performance profile of the PR-0003 prime log-gap analysis experiment, which claims sub-linear scaling with an efficiency factor of approximately 0.86. Our profiling reveals a more nuanced picture:

**Key Findings:**
1. **Overall scaling without visualization: 1.39x (SUPER-LINEAR)** - dominated by Ljung-Box autocorrelation test
2. **Claimed scaling with visualization: 0.82x (SUB-LINEAR)** - includes I/O and plot rendering
3. **Prime generation alone: 0.56x (SUB-LINEAR)** - benefit from segmented sieve and caching
4. **The "efficiency factor ~0.86" is misleading** - it conflates computational and I/O costs

---

## Program Flow Documentation

The PR-0003 experiment follows this pipeline:

### Phase 1: Prime Generation (Component: `1_prime_generation`)
**Source:** `src/prime_generator.py` - functions `segmented_sieve()` and `generate_primes_to_limit()`

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate small primes up to sqrt(limit) using basic Sieve of Eratosthenes
2. Process larger range in segments of 10^6 numbers
3. For each segment, mark composites using small primes
4. Collect primes from each segment

**Optimizations:**
- Segmented approach reduces memory footprint from O(n) to O(√n + segment_size)
- Disk caching avoids regeneration on subsequent runs
- Only processes odd numbers after 2 (implicit)

**Scaling Exponent:** 0.56 (SUB-LINEAR when cached)

**Why sub-linear?**
- On first run: Linear O(n log log n) from sieve algorithm
- On cached runs: O(1) disk read, appearing as sub-linear when comparing scales

### Phase 2: Gap Computation (Component: `2_gap_computation`)
**Source:** `src/prime_generator.py` - function `compute_gaps()`

**Algorithm:**
1. Compute regular gaps: `gaps[i] = primes[i+1] - primes[i]`
2. Compute log-primes: `log_primes[i] = ln(primes[i])`
3. Compute log-gaps: `log_gaps[i] = log_primes[i+1] - log_primes[i]`

**Optimizations:**
- Vectorized NumPy operations
- Disk caching using compressed .npz format

**Scaling Exponent:** 0.61 (SUB-LINEAR when cached)

**Why sub-linear?**
- Theoretical: O(n) for diff and log operations
- Observed: Caching makes it appear sub-linear

### Phase 3: Binning Analysis (Component: `3_binning_analysis`)
**Source:** `src/binning.py` - function `analyze_bins()`

**Algorithm:**
1. Create 100 equal-width bins on log-prime axis
2. Assign each log-gap to a bin using `np.digitize()`
3. Compute mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis per bin

**Optimizations:**
- NumPy's digitize is O(n log k) where k=100 bins
- Vectorized statistical computations

**Scaling Exponent:** 0.21 (HIGHLY SUB-LINEAR)

**Why highly sub-linear?**
- Fixed number of bins (100) regardless of data size
- Work per bin increases linearly, but number of bins is constant
- This is genuine algorithmic efficiency

### Phase 4: Statistical Tests (Components: `4a-4e`)

#### 4a. Linear Regression (Component: `4a_linear_regression`)
**Source:** `src/statistics.py` - function `linear_regression()`

**Algorithm:**
- Fit line to 100 bin means using scipy.stats.linregress()
- O(k) where k=100 (number of bins)

**Scaling Exponent:** 0.01 (EXTREMELY SUB-LINEAR)

**Why?**
- Fixed input size (100 bin means) regardless of data scale

#### 4b. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests (Component: `4b_ks_tests`)
**Source:** `src/statistics.py` - function `kolmogorov_smirnov_tests()`

**Algorithm:**
- Fit 6 distributions (normal, log-normal, exponential, gamma, Weibull, uniform)
- Run KS test for each: compare empirical CDF to theoretical CDF
- O(n log n) for sorting and CDF comparison

**Scaling Exponent:** 0.91 (NEAR-LINEAR)

**Why near-linear?**
- Scipy's kstest implementation is O(n log n)
- Fitting distributions is also O(n)
- Multiple distributions tested increases constant factor

**Performance at scales:**
- 10^6: 2.3s
- 10^7: 16.3s (7x increase for 8.5x data)

#### 4c. ACF/PACF (Component: `4c_acf_pacf`)
**Source:** `src/statistics.py` - function `compute_acf_pacf()`

**Algorithm:**
- Compute autocorrelation function using FFT method
- Compute partial autocorrelation
- Fixed number of lags (50)

**Scaling Exponent:** 0.92 (NEAR-LINEAR)

**Why near-linear?**
- FFT-based ACF is O(n log n)
- Fixed lag count (50) regardless of data size

**Performance at scales:**
- 10^6: 0.075s
- 10^7: 0.52s (6.9x increase for 8.5x data)

#### 4d. Ljung-Box Test (Component: `4d_ljung_box`)
**Source:** `src/statistics.py` - function `ljung_box_test()`

**Algorithm:**
- Test for autocorrelation at lags 1-50
- Computes squared autocorrelations for each lag
- statsmodels implementation

**Scaling Exponent:** 2.03 (SUPER-LINEAR / QUADRATIC)

**Why super-linear?**
- **THIS IS THE BOTTLENECK**
- Appears to have O(n²) or O(n·k²) complexity in statsmodels
- Dominates total runtime at larger scales

**Performance at scales:**
- 10^6: 0.58s
- 10^7: 44.5s (77x increase for 8.5x data!)

**Impact on overall scaling:**
- At 10^6: 18% of total time
- At 10^7: 72% of total time
- This single component destroys the sub-linear scaling claim

#### 4e. Moments (Component: `4e_moments`)
**Source:** `src/statistics.py` - function `compute_skewness_kurtosis()`

**Algorithm:**
- Compute skewness and kurtosis of log-gaps
- scipy.stats.skew() and scipy.stats.kurtosis()

**Scaling Exponent:** 0.59 (SUB-LINEAR)

**Why sub-linear?**
- Single-pass algorithms, O(n)
- Implementation may use sampling or approximations

### Phase 5: Visualization (Component: `6_visualization_prep`)
**Source:** `src/visualization_2d.py` and `src/visualization_3d.py`

**Not profiled in detail** - placeholder sleep(0.1) used

**Actual visualization costs (from RESULTS_AT_SCALE.md):**
- 12 2D plots + 5 3D plots = 17 total plots
- Estimated time at 10^7: ~80 seconds (from documentation)
- This is where the "sub-linear" appearance comes from

**Why visualization appears sub-linear:**
- Fixed resolution plots regardless of data size
- Downsampling for large datasets (e.g., scatter3d uses sample_size=10000)
- I/O bound (writing PNG files) is constant-time per plot

## Analysis of Scaling Claims

### Claim in PR #18 Description:
> "Execution scales sub-linearly (7x time for 8.5x data)"

### Claim in RESULTS_AT_SCALE.md:
> "Estimated based on observed sub-linear scaling (efficiency factor ~0.86)"

### Reality:
1. **Without visualization:** Overall scaling exponent = 1.39 (SUPER-LINEAR)
2. **With visualization:** Total time 13.5s → 94.9s = 7.0x for 8.5x data = 0.82 efficiency

### Calculation:
```
If time = k * n^α, then α = log(time_ratio) / log(data_ratio)
α = log(7.0) / log(8.5) = 0.845 / 0.929 = 0.91
```

So even with visualization, the scaling is nearly linear (0.91), not sub-linear.

### Why the discrepancy?
The "efficiency factor ~0.86" is calculated as:
```
efficiency_factor = time_ratio / data_ratio = 7.0 / 8.5 = 0.82
```

This is **NOT** a scaling exponent! It's a simple ratio.

True sub-linear scaling would have exponent < 1.0:
- If α = 0.86, then 8.5^0.86 = 7.2x, which is close to observed 7.0x
- But this is ONLY true if we include visualization time
- **The core computation WITHOUT visualization scales at α = 1.39 (SUPER-LINEAR)**

### The Visualization Effect:
From RESULTS_AT_SCALE.md:
- 10^6: "~13.5 seconds" total (3.7s compute + ~9.8s visualization)
- 10^7: "~94.9 seconds" total (61.6s compute + ~33.3s visualization)

Visualization time increased only ~3.4x for 8.5x data (exponent ~0.63), which is genuinely sub-linear due to:
1. Fixed plot resolutions
2. Downsampling (scatter3d limits to 10,000 points)
3. Constant I/O overhead per plot

This drags down the overall apparent scaling, creating the illusion of sub-linear scaling.

## Conclusions

### What is sub-linear?
- **Prime generation** (with caching): Yes, but this is an artifact of disk caching
- **Binning analysis**: Yes, genuinely sub-linear due to fixed number of bins
- **Visualization**: Yes, genuinely sub-linear due to downsampling and fixed resolutions
- **Linear regression on bins**: Yes, genuinely sub-linear due to fixed input size (100 bins)

### What is NOT sub-linear?
- **KS tests**: Near-linear (0.91), expected for O(n log n) algorithms
- **ACF/PACF**: Near-linear (0.92), expected for FFT-based approach
- **Ljung-Box test**: SUPER-linear (2.03), quadratic bottleneck
- **Overall computation**: SUPER-linear (1.39) when visualization excluded

### Root Cause of Performance Bottleneck:
**The Ljung-Box autocorrelation test** in `src/statistics.py` uses `statsmodels.stats.diagnostic.acorr_ljungbox()`, which appears to have O(n²) or O(n·k²) complexity. This dominates runtime at scale:
- 10^6: 0.58s (18% of time)
- 10^7: 44.5s (72% of time)
- **77x increase for 8.5x data** = 2.03 scaling exponent

### Recommendations:

1. **Replace Ljung-Box test with alternative**
   - Use approximate test or sampling
   - Compute on subset of data
   - Or accept that this component will scale quadratically

2. **Separate computation from visualization in performance claims**
   - Report "computational scaling" separately from "total pipeline scaling"
   - Current claim conflates the two

3. **Update documentation to clarify**
   - RESULTS_AT_SCALE.md should explain that sub-linear scaling comes from visualization
   - Core statistical analysis scales super-linearly due to autocorrelation test
   - The "efficiency factor ~0.86" is time_ratio/data_ratio, not a scaling exponent

4. **Optimize if scaling to 10^8 or 10^9**
   - Current Ljung-Box implementation will make 10^8 impractical
   - Estimated time for Ljung-Box alone at 10^8: ~3500 seconds (~1 hour)
   - Consider removing this test or using approximations

## Attribution of Performance Characteristics

### Genuine Algorithmic Efficiency (Sub-linear):
1. **Binning strategy**: Using fixed 100 bins on log-prime axis
   - Contribution: ~2% of runtime, but enables efficient downstream analysis
2. **Downsampling in visualizations**: Scatter plots limit to 10,000 points
   - Contribution: Keeps visualization time manageable (~35% of total pipeline)

### Caching Benefits (Apparent Sub-linear):
1. **Prime generation caching**: Disk storage of primes
   - Contribution: Eliminates ~200ms (10^6) to ~2s (10^7) on reruns
2. **Gap caching**: Disk storage of computed gaps
   - Contribution: Eliminates ~3ms (10^6) to ~20ms (10^7) on reruns

### Linear Scaling (Expected):
1. **KS distribution tests**: O(n log n) algorithms
   - Contribution: 26% of compute time at 10^7
2. **ACF/PACF**: FFT-based autocorrelation
   - Contribution: <1% of compute time

### Super-linear Scaling (Performance Problem):
1. **Ljung-Box test**: O(n²) or O(n·k²)
   - Contribution: **72% of compute time at 10^7**
   - **THIS IS THE DOMINANT FACTOR**

### Interaction Effects:
- The combination of sub-linear visualization + super-linear Ljung-Box + linear KS tests
- Creates overall scaling that APPEARS sub-linear (0.82 ratio) when including visualization
- But is actually super-linear (1.39 exponent) for core computation

### Novel vs. Standard:
- **Novel**: 100-bin log-prime axis strategy (genuinely efficient)
- **Novel**: Segmented sieve with caching (standard algorithm, good engineering)
- **Standard**: KS tests, ACF/PACF (expected linear scaling)
- **Standard but problematic**: Ljung-Box test (quadratic scaling is a known issue)

---

## Final Verdict

**The claimed "sub-linear scaling with efficiency factor ~0.86" is MISLEADING.**

**Correct statement:**
> "The complete pipeline including visualization exhibits a time ratio of 7.0x for 8.5x more data, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 0.82. This is primarily due to sub-linear visualization costs. However, the core statistical analysis without visualization scales super-linearly at exponent 1.39, dominated by the quadratic-complexity Ljung-Box autocorrelation test which accounts for 72% of computation time at the 10^7 scale."

**Impact:**
- The estimates for 10^8 (~15 min) and 10^9 (~3 hours) in RESULTS_AT_SCALE.md are UNDERESTIMATES
- True times if Ljung-Box is included:
  - 10^8: ~45 minutes (not 15 minutes)
  - 10^9: ~50 hours (not 3 hours)

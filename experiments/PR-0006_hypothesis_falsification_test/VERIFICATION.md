# Experiment Verification Checklist

## Requirements Met ✓

### From Problem Statement
- [x] Design and execute a test that will definitively prove or falsify the hypothesis
- [x] Create a new folder under 'experiments/' for all artifacts
- [x] Keep all artifacts within the new folder (no modifications outside)
- [x] Meticulously document findings in 'FINDINGS.md'
- [x] Lead FINDINGS.md with the conclusion
- [x] Follow with technical supporting evidence

### Hypothesis Components Tested
- [x] AI-augmented scientific falsification pipeline effectiveness
- [x] Distribution inconsistencies (exponential vs lognormal)
- [x] High-precision prime generation integration
- [x] Fractal-like cascades in gap sequences
- [x] Reversed hierarchy discovery mechanism
- [x] Bottom-up vs top-down pattern detection
- [x] False positive rate comparison

### Implementation Quality
- [x] Incremental coder protocol followed (one function at a time)
- [x] Each function fully implemented with proper documentation
- [x] Comments updated after each implementation
- [x] Clear dependency tracking maintained
- [x] No silent assumptions made

### Reproducibility
- [x] Fixed random seed (42)
- [x] Configuration saved to file
- [x] Complete experimental data preserved
- [x] Rerunnable from scratch
- [x] Dependencies documented in requirements.txt

### Output Files
- [x] FINDINGS.md (conclusion-first format)
- [x] SUMMARY.md (quick reference)
- [x] README.md (experiment overview)
- [x] TECH_SPEC.md (technical specification)
- [x] results/experiment_results.json (complete data)
- [x] results/summary.txt (statistics)
- [x] data/config.json (configuration)
- [x] run_experiment.py (implementation)

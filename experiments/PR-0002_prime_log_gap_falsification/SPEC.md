## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies an experiment designed to rigorously test and potentially falsify the hypothesis that prime number gaps in logarithmic space exhibit circuit-like damped impulse response behavior. The experiment extends preliminary findings (9,592 primes to 10âµ) to larger scales (10â¸+ primes) with formal statistical validation.

---

## 2. Hypothesis Under Test

### 2.1 Primary Hypothesis (H-MAIN)

**Statement:** Prime gaps in log-space, defined as Î”â‚™ = ln(pâ‚™â‚Šâ‚) - ln(pâ‚™) = ln(pâ‚™â‚Šâ‚/pâ‚™), exhibit statistical properties consistent with a multiplicative damped system, specifically:

1. **H-MAIN-A (Decay):** Mean log-gap decreases monotonically as primes increase
2. **H-MAIN-B (Distribution):** Log-gaps follow a log-normal or related heavy-tailed multiplicative distribution
3. **H-MAIN-C (Memory):** Log-gap autocorrelation exhibits short-range structure (non-zero at low lags)

### 2.2 Null Hypotheses (For Falsification)

| ID | Null Hypothesis | Falsification Condition |
|----|-----------------|------------------------|
| H0-A | Log-gap mean is constant or increasing | Quintile means show no decrease or increase with p |
| H0-B | Log-gaps are normally distributed | KS test p-value > 0.05 for normal fit, AND normal KS < log-normal KS |
| H0-C | Log-gaps are uncorrelated (white noise) | Ljung-Box test p-value > 0.05 at all lags â‰¤ 20 |
| H0-D | Log-gaps follow simple exponential decay | Exponential KS statistic < log-normal KS statistic |

### 2.3 Connection to Circuit Analogy

The hypothesis derives from the mapping:

| Electrical Domain | Number-Theoretic Domain |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Voltage v | Logarithm ln(n) |
| Current i | Log-ratio ln(pâ‚™â‚Šâ‚/pâ‚™) |
| Impulse response | Prime gap distribution |
| Damping coefficient | Log-gap decay rate |
| RC time constant | Characteristic scale of gap correlation |

### 2.4 Connection to Relativistic Bounds

The Gist "Proof and Analysis of Relativistic Doppler Shift Bounds" establishes:

$$\frac{\delta}{1+\delta} < \beta < \frac{\delta}{1-\delta} \quad (0 < \delta < 1)$$

via the rapidity identity artanh(Î²) = ln(1+Î´). This logarithmic compression parallels the treatment of integers as "potentials" in the circuit analogy, where logarithms bound multiplicative growth analogously to how Î² < 1 bounds relativistic velocity.

### 3.2 Derived Quantities

For each consecutive prime pair (pâ‚™, pâ‚™â‚Šâ‚):

```
log_gap[n] = ln(p[n+1]) - ln(p[n]) = ln(p[n+1] / p[n])
regular_gap[n] = p[n+1] - p[n]
log_prime[n] = ln(p[n])
```

### 3.3 Statistical Tests

#### 3.3.1 Test Suite

| Test ID | Test Name | Target Hypothesis | Implementation |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| T1 | Quintile Mean Regression | H-MAIN-A | Linear regression of quintile means vs quintile index |
| T2 | Decile Mean Regression | H-MAIN-A | Finer granularity check (10 bins) |

#### 3.3.2 Significance Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| p-value for rejection | < 0.01 | Conservative threshold to avoid false positives |
| KS statistic comparison | Ratio > 1.5 | One distribution fits substantially better |
| Regression RÂ² | > 0.90 | Strong linear relationship in decay |
| Slope significance | p < 0.001 | Decay slope is significantly negative |

### 3.4 Falsification Criteria

**The hypothesis is FALSIFIED if ANY of the following occur:**

1. **F1:** Quintile/decile means show non-decreasing trend (T1, T2 regression slope â‰¥ 0 with p > 0.05)
2. **F2:** Normal distribution fits log-gaps better than log-normal (T3: KS_normal < KS_lognormal)
3. **F3:** Log-gaps are indistinguishable from uniform random (T3: uniform KS p-value > 0.05)
4. **F4:** Autocorrelation is flat at all lags (T5: Ljung-Box p > 0.05 for all lags)
5. **F5:** Skewness and kurtosis are consistent with normal distribution (T7: |skewness| < 0.5, |excess kurtosis| < 1)
6. **F6:** Results at 10â¸ contradict results at 10âµ (directional inconsistency)

**The hypothesis is SUPPORTED (not proven) if:**

1. All falsification criteria fail to trigger
2. Log-normal or heavy-tailed fit is statistically superior
3. Decay trend is monotonic and statistically significant
4. Results are consistent across scales (10âµ â†’ 10â¶ â†’ 10â· â†’ 10â¸)

## 6. Expected Outcomes

### 6.1 If Hypothesis is Supported

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Log-normal fit confirmed at scale | Multiplicative structure in prime gaps is real |
| Decay rate consistent across scales | "Damping coefficient" is a stable invariant |
| Short-range autocorrelation | "Filter memory" model is viable |
| Heavy tails persist | Rare large gaps follow predictable statistics |

### 6.2 If Hypothesis is Falsified

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Normal distribution fits better | Circuit analogy breaks down; gaps are additive |
| No decay in log-gap means | Logarithmic "voltage" is not the right variable |
| White noise autocorrelation | No memory/filter structure exists |
| Scale-dependent reversals | Preliminary results were artifacts of small sample |

### 6.3 Theoretical Connections

**If supported**, the results suggest:

1. Rational bounds on prime density analogous to Î²â€“Î´ Doppler bounds
2. Transfer function formulation H(z) for prime-counting approximations
3. Poles/zeros corresponding to Riemann zeta structure

**These must be tested separately** and are not part of this experiment's scope.

## 7. Constraints and Limitations

### 7.1 What This Experiment Does NOT Test

1. Riemann Hypothesis implications
2. Cryptographic applications (key generation speedup)
3. CRISPR/bioinformatics applications
4. Specific transfer function designs
5. Predictions beyond the computed range

### 7.2 Known Limitations

1. Finite computational range (10â¸ or 10â¹ maximum practical)
2. Cannot distinguish between "true" log-normal and close approximations
3. Autocorrelation may be sensitive to window size choices
4. Heavy tails make variance estimates unstable

### 7.3 Potential Confounds

1. **Numerical precision:** Log of large primes may lose precision
   - Mitigation: Use np.float128 or mpmath for extended precision
2. **Edge effects:** First/last quintiles may behave differently
   - Mitigation: Exclude extreme quintiles in robustness checks
3. **Sieve artifacts:** Computational errors could create spurious patterns
   - Mitigation: Validate against known Ï€(x) at multiple checkpoints

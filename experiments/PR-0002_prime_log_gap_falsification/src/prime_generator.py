Prime Generator Module

This module generates prime numbers, which are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
In this experiment, primes are the foundation for studying "prime gaps" – the differences between consecutive primes.
We use efficient algorithms to handle large ranges (up to 10^8 primes) without using too much memory.

Imagine primes as evenly spaced "dots" on a number line, but the gaps between them grow larger on average.
This module creates those dots so we can measure the spaces.

def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Basic Sieve of Eratosthenes: An ancient method to find all primes up to a limit.

    How it works (like a game of elimination):
    1. Make a list of numbers from 0 to limit, marking them as "potentially prime" (True).
    2. Mark 0 and 1 as not prime (they're special cases).
    3. For each number starting from 2, if it's still marked prime, cross out all its multiples (like 2 eliminates 4, 6, 8, etc.).
    4. What's left unmarked are primes.

    This is efficient for smaller limits but uses a lot of memory for big numbers, so we only use it for small primes here.
    In our experiment, this helps generate "small primes" used to sieve larger ranges.

) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    """
    Segmented Sieve of Eratosthenes: A smarter version for large limits.

    Why segmented? The basic sieve needs a huge array for big limits (e.g., 10^8 numbers take 100MB+).
    Instead, we break the range into smaller "segments" (chunks of 1 million numbers) and sieve each one separately.
    This saves memory but takes a bit more time – a good trade-off for our experiment.

    Steps:
    1. First, use the basic sieve to get small primes up to sqrt(limit). These are our "tools" for sieving larger numbers.
    2. Divide the big range into segments.
    3. For each segment, mark non-primes using the small primes as filters.
    4. Collect the remaining primes in that segment.

    This is like cleaning a room in sections instead of the whole house at once.
    In the prime gap experiment, this lets us generate millions of primes efficiently for gap analysis.

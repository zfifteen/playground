# Data Artifacts: Prime Log-Gap Falsification Experiment

This document describes the key data files generated from the prime log-gap falsification experiment at the 10^6 scale. These artifacts store raw primes, computed log-gaps, and statistical summaries, enabling quick reloading for analysis, verification, or extension to larger datasets. They underpin the experiment's conclusion that the hypothesis (multiplicative damped prime gaps) is not falsified, through evidence like monotonic decay and log-normal fits.

## log_gaps_1000000.csv

CSV file containing 78,497 logarithmic prime gaps (Δ_n = ln(p_{n+1}/p_n)) derived from primes up to 10^6.

This single-column CSV (no header, comma-delimited) was generated by computing natural logarithms of consecutive prime pairs and taking their differences using NumPy's diff function. Values range from approximately 0.00002 to 0.511, with a mean of ~0.00113 and standard deviation of ~0.0109, exhibiting high positive skewness (~31.6) and heavy tails (excess kurtosis ~1,195). The data supports distribution tests (e.g., log-normal fit with KS=0.051) and autocorrelation analysis. Load in Python with `np.loadtxt('data/log_gaps_1000000.csv', delimiter=',')` for efficient reuse in statistical libraries like SciPy or Statsmodels.

## primes_1000000.npy

NumPy binary array of the first 78,498 primes up to 10^6, starting from 2.

This .npy file stores a 1D array of uint64 integers generated via the segmented sieve algorithm in prime_generator.py, optimized for large ranges with low memory usage. The count matches π(10^6) = 78,498, validated against known prime-counting tables. Primes range from 2 to 999,983, serving as the foundation for log-gap computations and potential extensions (e.g., to 10^7 or 10^8). Load with `primes = np.load('data/primes_1000000.npy')`; inspect with `primes[:10]` for the first 10 values (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]). File size is ~615 KB, enabling fast loading without recomputation.

## analysis_1000000.npy

NumPy-serialized dictionary summarizing statistical results from the full 10^6 analysis pipeline.

This binary file contains a Python dict with keys like 'basic_stats' (mean=0.00113, std=0.0109, skewness=31.6, kurtosis=1195), 'quintile_means' (array of 5 decreasing values), 'quintile_regression' (slope=-0.082, R²=0.81, p=0.038), 'best_distribution' ('lognormal', KS=0.051), and 'significant_acf_lags' (list of correlated lags). Generated in run_analysis.py by aggregating outputs from log_gap_analysis.py, distribution_tests.py, and autocorrelation.py. Load with `analysis = np.load('results/analysis_1000000.npy', allow_pickle=True).item()`; use for quick falsification checks or cross-scale comparisons. File size is ~1 KB, preserving computational results without rerunning the full ~10-second pipeline.
